# 738_Project_2
Text Prediction and Text Generation with Hidden Markov Models

#Implementation
For this project I decided to use the shakespeare plays dataset and then use a markov model to then be able to craft predictive text and then also text generation in that style

# Data
The datasets used are quite large, given that they are nlp datasets. 
So I will just post the urls where I would pull the data from. Data comes the locations:
